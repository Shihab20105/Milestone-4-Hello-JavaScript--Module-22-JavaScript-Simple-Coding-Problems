Why Is the Last Element an Empty String?
This happens because the string ends with a '.'. When 'split()' encounters the delimiter at the end, it creates an empty string as the last element in the array.

If You Want to Remove the Empty String:
You can filter out the empty string using:

/* 
The '... 47 more' items in the output occurs because the console in some environments (like browsers or Node.js) truncates long arrays to make the output easier to read. It doesn't mean the items are missingâ€”they're just not shown in the preview. The full array is still available in memory.

* How to View the Full Output

1. Access the Array Directly:
After running your code, you can click on the array in your console to expand it and view all its elements (if your environment supports it, like browser developer tools).

2. Use a Loop or 'console.log' Entirely:
To explicitly print all characters, you can use: 
chars.forEach(char => console.log(char));
This will print each character on a new line.

3. Use 'JSON.stringify' for Full Array Output:
Convert the array to a string to display it completely:
console.log(JSON.stringify(chars));

4. Limit the Array Preview in Code:
If the array is too large, you can slice it to preview a specific portion:
console.log(chars.slice(0, 50)); // Prints the first 50 characters

5. Inspect Programmatically:
Check the array's length to confirm the number of items:
console.log(chars.length);

The ... 47 more items is just a way for the environment to signal that the array is larger than the displayed preview, not that it's incomplete.
